## 🧠 What is VibeKit?

VibeKit is an SDK for running powerful coding agents like **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Gemini CLI**, and **SST Opencode** in secure, customizable sandboxes. You can generate and execute real code safely, stream output to your UI, and run everything in the cloud — with full isolation and flexibility. Local execution coming soon.

One SDK. Any coding agent. Any sandbox.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm i @vibe-kit/sdk
```

```javascript
import { VibeKit } from "@vibe-kit/sdk";
import { createE2BProvider } from "@vibe-kit/e2b";

const e2bProvider = createE2BProvider({
  apiKey: process.env.E2B_API_KEY!,
  templateId: "vibekit-claude",
});

const vibeKit = new VibeKit()
  .withAgent({
    type: "claude",
    provider: "anthropic",
    apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!,
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  })
  .withSandbox(e2bProvider);
```
