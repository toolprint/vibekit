## Docker Deployment

For any platform that supports Docker containers:

### Basic Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g @vibe-kit/proxy
EXPOSE 8080
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
CMD ["npx", "@vibe-kit/proxy", "start"]
```

### Multi-stage Build (Production)

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g @vibe-kit/proxy

FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S vibekit -u 1001
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@vibe-kit/proxy /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@vibe-kit/proxy
RUN ln -s /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@vibe-kit/proxy/src/cli.js /usr/local/bin/vibekit-proxy
USER vibekit
EXPOSE 8080
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
CMD ["npx", "@vibe-kit/proxy", "start"]
```

## Local Development

For local testing and development:

### Docker Compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  vibekit-proxy:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs
```

### Direct Installation

```bash
# Install and run locally
npm install -g @vibe-kit/proxy
npx @vibe-kit/proxy start --port 8080
```

## Environment Configuration

Configure the proxy for different environments:

```bash
# Production environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
VIBEKIT_PROXY_TARGET_URL=https://api.anthropic.com
```

## Health Monitoring

The proxy exposes a `/health` endpoint for monitoring:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "requestCount": 1234
}
```

## Security Best Practices

- Use HTTPS termination at load balancer
- Run containers as non-root user
- Implement rate limiting
- Restrict network access with security groups/firewall rules
- Regular security updates

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Port binding errors**: Ensure port 8080 is available
2. **Memory limits**: Monitor and adjust container memory
3. **Network connectivity**: Check security groups and firewall rules
4. **Health check failures**: Verify `/health` endpoint accessibility

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check proxy status
npx @vibe-kit/proxy status

# View container logs  
docker logs vibekit-proxy-container
```
