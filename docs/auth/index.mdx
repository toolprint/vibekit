## Why Use MAX Subscriptions?

Instead of paying per API call, leverage the subscriptions you already have:

- **Cost Effective**: Use your existing MAX subscriptions instead of pay-per-use APIs
- **Higher Limits**: MAX subscriptions often have higher rate limits and priority access  
- **Latest Models**: Access to the newest and most capable models in each provider's lineup
- **Consistent Experience**: Same interface across different AI providers

Whether you're building a CLI tool, web application, or any project that needs AI capabilities, @vibe-kit/auth provides a secure, scalable authentication foundation that works with your existing subscriptions.
