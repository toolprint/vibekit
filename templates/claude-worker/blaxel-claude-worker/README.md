## ‚ú® Features

- Containerized sandbox environment for secure code execution
- Pre-configured development environment with essential tools
- Seamless integration with Blaxel platform for cloud deployment
- Local Docker support for development and testing
- Isolated file system for safe code experimentation
- Support for multiple programming languages and tools
- Easy connection and interaction with Claude Code sessions

## üöÄ Quick Start

For those who want to get up and running quickly:

```bash
# Or use blaxel CLI
bl create-sandbox YOUR-SANDBOX-NAME -y -t template-sandbox-codegen

# Navigate to the project directory
cd template-sandbox-claude-code

# Deploy to Blaxel
bl deploy

# Wait for your sandbox to be deployed
bl get sandbox YOUR-SANDBOX-NAME --watch

# Connect to your deployed sandbox
bl connect sandbox YOUR-SANDBOX-NAME
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Blaxel Platform Setup:** Complete Blaxel setup by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started#quickstart)
  - **[Blaxel CLI](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started):** Ensure you have the Blaxel CLI installed. If not, install it globally:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
    ```
  - **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel platform
    ```bash
    bl login YOUR-WORKSPACE
    ```

## üíª Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-sandbox-claude-code.git
cd template-sandbox-claude-code
```

No additional dependencies need to be installed as everything runs in containers.

## üîß Usage

### Running Locally with Docker

Build and run the sandbox container locally:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
make build

# Run the container
make run
```

This will start the sandbox environment with ports 8080 and 3000 exposed for development.

### Deploying to Blaxel

When you are ready to deploy your sandbox to the cloud:

```bash
bl deploy
```

This command uses your code and the configuration in `blaxel.toml` to deploy your sandbox environment on the Blaxel platform.

### Connecting to Sandbox

Once deployed, you can connect to your sandbox:

```bash
bl connect sandbox YOUR-SANDBOX-NAME
```

Replace `YOUR-SANDBOX-NAME` with the actual name of your deployed sandbox.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Dockerfile** - Container configuration for the sandbox environment
- **Makefile** - Build and run commands for local development
- **entrypoint.sh** - Container startup script
- **blaxel.toml** - Blaxel deployment configuration (sandbox type)

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Issues**:
   - Ensure Docker is running and accessible
   - Try `docker --version` to verify Docker installation
   - Check that ports 8080 and 3000 are available

2. **Blaxel Platform Issues**:
   - Ensure you're logged in to your workspace: `bl login MY-WORKSPACE`
   - Verify sandbox deployment: `bl get sandboxes`
   - Check deployment status: `bl logs sandbox YOUR-SANDBOX-NAME`

3. **Connection Issues**:
   - Verify the sandbox is running: `bl get sandboxes`
   - Check sandbox logs for errors: `bl logs sandbox YOUR-SANDBOX-NAME`
   - Ensure your Blaxel CLI is up to date
